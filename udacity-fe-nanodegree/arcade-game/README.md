The aim of the game is to see how many times you can cross the stone paths and reach the water while avoiding being hit by the enemies on the screen. Use the direction arrows (**up**, **down**, **right**, **left**) to control the player in the same direction repectively. If you get hit by the enemy, your score resets and you start all over again.
