To play this game, Click [here](https://ofunmito.github.io/udacity-fe-nanodegree/arcade-game).

The aim of the game is to see how many times you can cross the stone paths and reach the water while avoiding being hit by the enemies on the screen within the set time (1 minute). Each crossing of the river earns you 1 point. 

See how many points you can gather before your time runs out

Use the direction arrows (**up**, **down**, **right**, **left**) to control the player in the same direction repectively.

If you get hit by the enemy, your score reduces by 1. At the end of the game time, your score is returned to you.

Enjoy your time playing!
