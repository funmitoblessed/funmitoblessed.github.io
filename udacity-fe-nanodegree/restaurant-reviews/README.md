## Overview

A static webpage is converted to a mobile-ready web application. The static design lacked accessibility and was converted to a webpage that is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Specification

Usable and responsive on desktop and mobile, standard Accessibility features are included and works offline (caches pages visited once).

## Installation

To run the application:

[Download](https://github.com/ofunmito/restaurant-reviews-app/archive/master.zip) the zip file or [git clone](https://github.com/ofunmito/restaurant-reviews-app.git) the repository to your computer.
