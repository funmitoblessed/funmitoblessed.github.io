                <span>Founded in 2006, One Acre Fund supplies smallholder farmers with the agricultural services they need to make their farms vastly more productive. We provide quality farm supplies on credit, delivered within walking distance of farmers' homes, and agricultural trainings to improve harvests. We measure our success by our ability to make farmers more prosperous: On average, farmers harvest 50 percent more food after working with One Acre Fund. 
                    We are growing quickly, as we currently serve more than 1 million farm families in Africa, with more than 8,000 full-time staff, and we aim to serve more farmers every year.</span>
                <br>

                <h6 class="page-section-heading text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-0">ABOUT NIGERIA</h6> <br>
                <span>Nigeria is one of One Acre Fund's two pilot programs. Our team is based in Niger State and is currently serving over 8000 farmers. The program is focused on adapting the One Acre Fund model to meet the agronomic, cultural, and business contexts of northern Nigeria. We offer farmers hybrid maize seed and fertilizer and herbicide for various crops, as well as improved storage solutions. Our program has proven impactful - over the last 2 years, we have increased the average farmer's maize yield between 25% and 100%.</span>
